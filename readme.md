# CodeIgniter Foundation #

## CodeIgniter pre-cofigured with Sparks and ion_auth. ##

## The Zurb Foundation CSS framework is included. ##

The idea is to clone this repo whenever you start a new CI project. You then have sparks and a simple header/footer templating system to get going with using Zurb's Excellent CSS Foundation.

Don't forget to import the ion_auth sql tables into your database.
